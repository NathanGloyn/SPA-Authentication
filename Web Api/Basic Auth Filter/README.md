# Basic Auth - Custom Authorization Filter

This sample shows how to implement basic authentication utilising a custom authorization filter.

The bulk of the code for this sample came from a [post](http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2013/Apr/18/A-WebAPI-Basic-Authentication-Authorization-Filter) by Rick Strahl which I've customised a bit.
